Mini Project - Search Enging for Wikipedia

Pooja Desur - 2019101112

A search engine with parsed English Wikipedia data of 21 million documents
that will return top 10 most relevant results in terms of General and Field Queries.

In order to run, my_index and titles directory need to be present in the parent directory.
These contain the inverted index and the titles of all documents respectively which the search engine uses to get relevant results.

To run : python3 search.py queries.txt
Output generated: queries_op.txt in the same directory

Files Divided:
* Inverted Index (my_index) - divided into 36 files saved on local machine - generated by parsing through all 21 million documents
* titles - divided into 428 files each of which has 50000 titles in order of the document id that was parsed
* index.py - creates tokenized inverted index that saves frequency of each token in a document in terms of its fields
* search.py - gets top 10 relevant results based on tfidf score of each token in a query, either general or field
